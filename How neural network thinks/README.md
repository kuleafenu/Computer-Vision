In this code sample, we try to understand why the neural network made a particular prediction. 
We use visualization (a heatmap) to understand the decision-making that is going on within the network. 
Using color, we visually identify the areas within an image that prompted a decision. **Hotspots**, represented by warmer colors `(red, orange, and yellow)` highlight the areas with the maximum signal, whereas cooler colors `(blue, purple)` indicate low signal.

### This codes will show you realtime predictions of images in video and also demonstrate how it concentrates in it's predictions.
